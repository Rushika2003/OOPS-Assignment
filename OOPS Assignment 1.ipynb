    "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "ANS: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. An object      can be thought of as a real-world entity that contains both data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is a class in OOP? \n",
    "ANS: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the            objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is an object in OOP? \n",
    "ANS: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity that has:\n",
    "     State (stored in attributes or variables)\n",
    "     Behavior (defined by methods or functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ? \n",
    "ANS: Abstraction = Hide implementation details, show only essential features.\n",
    "     Encapsulation = Hide data, provide controlled access to it.\n",
    "     Both together help make OOP systems more secure, modular, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python? \n",
    "ANS: In Python, dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") are special methods that have two leading and trailing underscores, like             __init__, __str__, or __len__.\n",
    "     These methods are also called:\n",
    "     Magic methods\n",
    "     Special methods\n",
    "     Double underscore methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
    "ANS: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a core concept where a class (child or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors             (attributes and methods) from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
    "     It allows you to reuse code, extend functionality, and promote modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "ANS: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism means “many forms” — it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a           common superclass, typically through a shared interface or method name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's data and providing controlled access through methods                   (getters/setters). While Python doesn’t enforce strict access modifiers like private or protected in languages such as Java or C++, it uses            naming conventions to indicate intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated      from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "ANS: n Python, class methods and static methods are two special kinds of methods inside a class, different from regular instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11.  What is method overloading in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Python does NOT support traditional method overloading like Java or C++.\n",
    "     In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the last one defined overwrites the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "ANS: Method overriding happens when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent (super) class.\n",
    "     The method in the subclass has the same name, same parameters, and same return type as in the parent class.\n",
    "     It replaces or modifies the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "     Enables runtime polymorphism — the program decides which method to call based on the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "ANS: The @property decorator in Python is a way to define methods that act like attributes—allowing you to get, set, or delete values with simple           attribute-like syntax, but still keep control over how the value is accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "ANS: olymorphism is super important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it makes your code more flexible, reusable, and easy to extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It defines one or more       abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "ANS: 1. Modularity\n",
    "     Code is organized into classes and objects, which makes it easier to manage and maintain.You can work on individual classes independently without      affecting the whole program.\n",
    "     2. Reusability\n",
    "     Through inheritance, you can reuse existing code by creating new classes based on existing ones.Saves development time and reduces redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "ANS: Class variables are shared among all instances. Instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
    "ANS: oth __str__ and __repr__ are special dunder methods in Python that control how objects are represented as strings, but they serve different            purposes: \n",
    "     Use __repr__ for developers/debugging — it should be precise and detailed.\n",
    "     Use __str__ for end users — it should be clean and easy to read.\n",
    "     If you only implement one, implement __repr__ — because when __str__ is missing, Python falls back on __repr__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
    "ANS: The super() function is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a subclass. It helps you access and extend the behavior of             inherited methods without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "ANS: The __del__ method is a destructor — a special method called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It lets you clean up         resources like files, network connections, or memory before the object is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Feature\t  @staticmethod  \t                                     @classmethod\n",
    "First parameter\t  No special first parameter (self or cls)\t             Takes cls (the class itself) as the first parameter\n",
    "Access to class\t  Does not have access to class or instance data\t     Has access to class attributes and other class methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "ANS: Polymorphism means different classes can define methods with the same name, and Python will call the correct method based on the actual object         type at runtime, even if you access the object through a parent class reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "ANS: Method chaining is a technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another. Each method returns the         object itself (self), so you can \"chain\" the calls together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "ANS: The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define __call__ in a class, you can use parentheses ()        on its objects, just like calling a regular function.\n",
